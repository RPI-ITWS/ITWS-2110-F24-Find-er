Important Notes: 
   Vendor is the Library folder holding all of the libraries that we are using for the project

   Database: 
      One in XAMPP Testing and one for our actual group server. Load in the db.sql for Xampp testing, 

      When developing, just use .env variables, if our group server database is the same as our xampp database then all of the code should work
      perfect and the only thing you would need to change when switching between the 2 is the .env files (for the mysqli calls) 
         in order to do so on our group server, you would use nano 

      .env for xampp (already set up in github rn ):
      DB_HOST=localhost
      DB_NAME=finder_db
      DB_USER=root
      DB_PASS=''
      
      using cloudinary to manage our images 
         reasoning is because we don't want our db to be too heavy. 
         putting images directly into it will slow it down significantly 

   Normal users without a recorder passkey can only make lost item requests
   In order for a lost item to be added to the database, a user must find it, they can click on a report lost item button and it will give them 
      instructions to bring it to the neareast apo office. Once it gets there, a recorder can add it to the database

   PhpMailer: 
      does not work when you are sending an email to yourself from XAMPP 

Current: 
   Working in CSS issue fix, see last commit in CSS-Issue-Fix Branch 
   

Notes for future: 
   Only really need one phpmyadmin for an entire server 

Takeaways from presentation: 
   prebuilt location categories
   prebuilt item type categories
   maybe defining feature
   

XAMMP Notes: 
   Literally just a live webserver good for development that running locally off my computer, no pulling needed. 
   made an Alias of htDocs and that is where my repo is going to live for now 
   Auto updated testing through XAMPP: http://localhost/ITWS-2110-F24-Find-er/
   Link to our DB 


Preface for Midterm Presentation: 
   "before we get started with the demo, we just wanted to preface you with some areas in which we are specifically looking for feedback: 
      we are going to go over some lost item submission forms, We'd love to know if you think theres anything we should also add. 
      We have a home dashboard so our user has easy acsess to all of there actions, We'd love some constructive critisism on the layout. 
      Also any comments on the layout of the form submissions would be appreciated

Midterm Takeaways: 
   When trying to match an item, It should respond with either "FOUND" or "not found yet, will notify you if anything enters the database 
   matching this description" 

to do: 
   Make Item Form PAge -> front end looking nice, √
   familiar with entire site operations √
   predefined tags -> put char limits on html's √
   Go through opps for improvement on lab6
   learn cloudinary 
   Found items form functionality to the DB
   connect to xampp database and get .env's working
      Just note:    PhpMailer: 
      does not work when you are sending an email to yourself from XAMPP  
 

Questions: 
   how did you block users from just messing with the title, in order to get to the next page


Quiz 2 notes: 
   Security things we added: 

      To stop people that are not logged in to getting to pages they are not supposed to, 
      we stored the user_id and related information in session variables, along with wether 
      they are a recorder or a user. 
      if (!isset($_SESSION['user_id'])) {
         header("Location: login.php");
         exit();
      }

Optimizations: 
   Put Javascript file at the bottom of the HTML to help the page run faster
