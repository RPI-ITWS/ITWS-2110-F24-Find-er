Important Notes: 
   Vendor is the Library folder holding all of the libraries that we are using for the project

   Database: 
      One in XAMPP Testing and one for our actual group server. Load in the db.sql for Xampp testing, 

      When developing, just use .env variables, if our group server database is the same as our xampp database then all of the code should work
      perfect and the only thing you would need to change when switching between the 2 is the .env files (for the mysqli calls) 
         in order to do so on our group server, you would use nano 

      .env for xampp (already set up in github rn ):
      DB_HOST=localhost
      DB_NAME=finder_db
      DB_USER=root
      DB_PASS=''
      
      using cloudinary to manage our images 

   Normal users without a recorder passkey can only make lost item requests
   In order for a lost item to be added to the database, a user must find it, they can click on a report lost item button and it will give them 
      instructions to bring it to the neareast apo office. Once it gets there, a recorder can add it to the database

   PhpMailer: 
      does not work when you are sending an email to yourself froom XAMPP 

Current State: 
   Vendor is where all of our libraries are stored 

Notes for future: 
   Only really need one phpmyadmin for an entire server 

Takeaways from presentation: 
   prebuilt location categories
   prebuilt item type categories
   maybe defining feature
   

XAMMP Notes: 
   Literally just a live webserver good for development that running locally off my computer, no pulling needed. 
   made an Alias of htDocs and that is where my repo is going to live for now 
   Auto updated testing through XAMPP: http://localhost/ITWS-2110-F24-Find-er/
   Link to our DB 


   

to do: 
   Make Item Form PAge -> front end looking nice, Understand how to link that to the sql database setup -> use ITWS lab
