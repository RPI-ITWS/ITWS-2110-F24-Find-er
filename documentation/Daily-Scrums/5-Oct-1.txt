Thomas, Mius: Yeah, I have time. I don't really have anything else really to do it's.

Thomas, Mius: Yeah, that makes sense. Yeah.
Fodera, Joseph: After everyone, these are supposed to be fifteen minutes just check in, keep working on the, things that we assigned.
Fodera, Joseph: Couple days ago.
Fodera, Joseph: Because when or what is it? Tomorrow, Wednesday we're all drowning at work right now I'm sure.
Thomas, Mius: That's the business right now, but I guess this helps.
Thomas, Mius: Wanna.
Thomas, Mius: Schedule our retrospective with Alan or if It's Callian so we could do either one.
Fodera, Joseph: So honestly, whatever works best for our schedules.
Fodera, Joseph: So we'll settle on a time or I mean, I think we should just settle on a time and then we'll.
Fodera, Joseph: We'll Settle a lot of time and then we'll just send it to Callionne or no, we'll send it to one of them first, whichever one we want, and then if they say we can't, then we ask the other. You know what I mean? Yeah.
Thomas, Mius: Yeah.
Lee, Derek: Do we want to do it this weekend or.
Fodera, Joseph: I mean I, I can do it anytime Friday, any time Saturday or I mean not anytime. I can do it anytime Friday or Sunday. I'm gonna be just running away both those days, so.
Lee, Derek: Sunday.
Heidi Zhou: Yeah, I can just send the upper twelve.
Fodera, Joseph: Monday after twelve, ok. I think.
Thomas, Mius: Sunday at one, so I probably be free after like three or four ish.
Fodera, Joseph: What, what sport do you plan Miles?
Thomas, Mius: The Soccer.
Fodera, Joseph: Oh, you're, are you, are you clubber varsity?
Thomas, Mius: I'm a worst thing, no.
Fodera, Joseph: How is that, where do you, do you guys travel out or are they, are they usually gifts?
Thomas, Mius: We travel like this past weekend we had two way games and one was like a two hour drive, the other was like an hour and a half.
Fodera, Joseph: You know, and that's for real. Yeah.
Thomas, Mius: It's kind of rough, but.
Thomas, Mius: No, it's fun. It's worth it. That's fun, definitely it's worth it. I'm like kind of.
Thomas, Mius: Dealing with some injuries though, so it's.
Fodera, Joseph: Yeah Alex, you know, I'm part of the, I'm part of the running club and we do, we don't do anything during the week. I know how you're doing stuff during the week. Like we run it but like it's just normal practice, but we'll do like meets in the weekends far away.
Thomas, Mius: So I can.
Fodera, Joseph: To that struggle, but not during the week. That's insane.
Thomas, Mius: Look I mean at least we haven't had to like travel like far during the week and if we do like our games are pretty late, like.
Thomas, Mius: Today, I mean, I think we've only had like one or two other like week games and they're just like Tuesday nights. I think the furthest we've gone on the weekend or like a weekday is like, I don't know, like twenty, thirty minutes. It's not.
Fodera, Joseph: Not bad on.
Thomas, Mius: Hour time block that I'm losing three four ish hours.
Fodera, Joseph: Does the university pay for your travel?
Thomas, Mius: And Partially, it's like partially funded by the engine, partially like some of like the games this past weekend, we had to carple before. Yeah. Which I don't really know like like someone like I think this coming weekend on Sunday we have a game at mass, which is like.
Thomas, Mius: Like two and a half hour drive, but I know that's that one's my bus which is getting paid for. But I don't really know.
Thomas, Mius: Which I don't know why somewhere like we get funded towards when we don't, but it is what it is. We make.
Fodera, Joseph: That's definitely fun. Yeah, they just, they pay like half of our race due. So like every race that we run in, there's like a fee and the union just pays for half of that.
Thomas, Mius: Ah, ok. So.
Fodera, Joseph: That's a nice cake though, that sounds cool.
Fodera, Joseph: All right. The.
Fodera, Joseph: The So we're all four of us are good for Sunday after three in terms of that meeting, right?
Heidi Zhou: Oh yeah.
Thomas, Mius: I.
Fodera, Joseph: Honestly, I say we just, we're already halfway there. I'll just send Cooper the transcript.
Fodera, Joseph: I'm.
Fodera, Joseph: So Sunday after three, and then we we should rearrange our schedule. Can everyone open in the.
Fodera, Joseph: In our repo.
Fodera, Joseph: And Miles you're still on your phone, right? I could just present it honestly.
Thomas, Mius: Yeah, I'm.
Fodera, Joseph: So, so.
Fodera, Joseph: I can find it here. So we made our sprint one timeline.
Fodera, Joseph: Alright, can you see this doc?
Thomas, Mius: Yeah I can see it.
Fodera, Joseph: All right. So this was our original timeline. Like he actually kind of gave me a many heart attack at the beginning when.
Fodera, Joseph: He said sprint one was supposed to be done by now, but.
Fodera, Joseph: Like obviously from when we first started it was four weeks so I was just behind on I guess I just was not locked in when he was talking about the deadlines, but.
Fodera, Joseph: We planned it out where our first sprint would end on the sixteenth. So we're not like drastically behind any sort of timeline. So that's good at least, we'll just have a longer second sprint I guess.
Fodera, Joseph: The.
Fodera, Joseph: The.
Fodera, Joseph: So how should we adjust this? So like, what is it?
Fodera, Joseph: Our sprint one will end.
Fodera, Joseph: On what is Sunday.

Lee, Derek: Yeah.
Fodera, Joseph: And this brand, and.
Fodera, Joseph: Start sprint.
Fodera, Joseph: And our retrospective, I was just looking what things are we supposed to talk about.
Lee, Derek: I think we just talked about what we've done so far.
Fodera, Joseph: Accomplished, right? We don't have to talk about our plans for the next sprint cause I was thinking we just plan out our next sprint after the retrospective.
Lee, Derek: Yeah.
Thomas, Mius: I think I think part of the retrospective is like readjusting for like what we did or didn't accomplish.
Fodera, Joseph: So that's good.
Fodera, Joseph: So we'll just say start sprint two planning on the fifth.
Fodera, Joseph: I'm yeah, and then we'll just adjust I don't know if you guys saw it in the discord. I just put in like.

Fodera, Joseph: Oh Cool, then that's what we'll plan on, and I think we'll be pretty much got everything unless.
Cooper Kelly: This is anyone.
Fodera, Joseph: Is anything else to add.
Heidi Zhou: It's been kind of like questions gonna ask. So like for the contract contact us, I was planning to do like a contact with like a staff.
Heidi Zhou: The, the kind of thing that you have in your mind, you think of like a contact form, a contact us page.
Fodera, Joseph: Just like a contact us page where you literally like I you can make like a discord server or something and put a link there to maybe like make up a Gmail email and put that there.
Cooper Kelly: Okay, for the about us, sorry, for the about us, do you want to do just our mission statement and do you want me to put a little piece for each, for each person on the team? I'll this.
Fodera, Joseph: I'm definitely like a mission statement and what we are and what we're about to.
Cooper Kelly: Know what we would want.
Fodera, Joseph: So if you really have some time on your hands and yet you could ask, I mean, I'm fine with each of us writing like a little two sentence blurb.
Cooper Kelly: Well, ok, I'll at least start with the mission statement thing and see how that looks and then if I feel like I can fit it in, then maybe after this sprint we can I can add that in.
Fodera, Joseph: Okay, just yeah, as long as it really just looks nice, I mean just look up example like about us pages pictures and something like that, make a look nice and spiffy.
Cooper Kelly: I can I can base it off some of the other page. We have some of the, we have some other pages already in the repository, right, that I can use like kind of CSS off and stuff.
Fodera, Joseph: Background and stuff like that. Yeah, definitely keep that constant, and also use. Wire frame I don't think you put enough outers page in there, but just like for the general flow of the pages, you know.
Cooper Kelly: Yeah, and then I get base it off some of the other pages and just change up some HTML. Keith, the CSS relatively similar, and it's trying to be too hard.
Fodera, Joseph: Now as long as it's the same style, I think where it will be ok.
Cooper Kelly: Yeah, sound.
Heidi Zhou: CSS like for the background is some kind of like like a color that's like a translated what's called again, anyway, it's like a green name.
Cooper Kelly: Transparent.
Heidi Zhou: It's a two collect.
Cooper Kelly: Yeah, I know what you mean. I know what you mean.
Heidi Zhou: Screen share for a second.
Lee, Derek: Yeah.
Heidi Zhou: I feel like, how should I say, see.
Heidi Zhou: Not sure how to share my show studio.
Cooper Kelly: A little bit.
Heidi Zhou: The entire screen.
Cooper Kelly: Three and a half years. Day.
Heidi Zhou: So it's like necessary here.
Cooper Kelly: Sees have made these problems.
Fodera, Joseph: Right.
Cooper Kelly: We have.
Fodera, Joseph: Try to keep.
Cooper Kelly: Okay, do we want to keep the background or? Yeah I feel like we should keep the keep the background in the general style of the website the same throughout.
Heidi Zhou: Yeah, I will fix the first because.
Cooper Kelly: Used similar fonts and stuff like that, obviously same background.
Fodera, Joseph: So I would just change the background high but I like that layout for.
Heidi Zhou: I need to fix the tss.
Cooper Kelly: If we do the sale thing we've been doing for the last three and a half years, we need change, we need a new direction, we need a president who has already done this.
Fodera, Joseph: Actually are they actually like talking.
Cooper Kelly: Transfer.
Fodera, Joseph: I guess yelling over each other.
Cooper Kelly: It's no this this space actually a lot more like a real debate compared to the compared to the presidential one which was really, really dumb. This one is actually a lot better. A lot more professional. Yeah.
Fodera, Joseph: Really how it goes out, I guess.
Cooper Kelly: Yeah, like a real debate or.
