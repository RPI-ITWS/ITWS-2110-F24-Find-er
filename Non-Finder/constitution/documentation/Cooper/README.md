My first responsibility was to work on the history of the Constitution.
At first this seemed like it would be a tall task duscussing the entire history of the constitition, but I found it wasn't so.
The main source I used to gain most of my information for the history was this: https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/more-perfect-union
Before I finished up the history, we had the idea of implementing a timeline on the history page, which I think will come out very nice.
Though this took a fairly long time to complete, I enjoyed brushing up on a little bit of American history and concepts from intro.
