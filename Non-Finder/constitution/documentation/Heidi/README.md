20th Amendment to 27 Amendment 


Once you’ve marked up the document well, annotate the Constitution with a more in-depth analysis (suitable for teaching other RPI students) of the Articles and Amendments. 

The goal is to help increase civic understanding and civic participation (think: how is the Constitution relevant in your lives today?). There are lots of web apps/sites that do this: google around for inspiration, but don’t steal their analysis verbatim (that’s plagiarism!). 

The analysis has to be in your own words, and must feature your own ideas about these things. A single sentence or two won’t do! You also must discuss the history of the Constitution somewhere in your app!

Note: Some section of the constitution were confusing to understand so i search them up and learn more about their history and purpose. I think
it's fascinating to see how a good portion of the amendment were fought to be ratify and how it affect today's lives.

Any challenges: 

Intinally, i was just summerizing the content of the constitution without analysising the history behind it's creation and I felt my notes were 
too general and messy for people to understand. I try to fix this by going back to organize the structure of my notes and include more details. 
It did felt I improve the readability and gain better understanding of the constitution.
