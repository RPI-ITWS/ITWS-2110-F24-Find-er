# Project Log

### 9/9/24:
- Created the website and copied all articles and amendments from the Constitution.
  - [Constitution Source](https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/)

### 9/11/24:
- Styled the website with basic CSS.

### 9/12/24:
- Added JavaScript functionality to toggle the display of sections.
- Implemented smooth scrolling to corresponding sections when navigation links are clicked.
- Improved section readability with additional styling.
- Made the website more responsive.

Stuck/Unstuck: I got stuck in a dilemma because I wanted to make to separate the artticles and amendments. First I wanted to separate them to dynamically generate their own page for each article and amendment but realized it wouldn't work because of how the project is already structured. I got unstuck by deciding to separate the articles, amendments, and historys to their own page on the site. It still get the job done and it's a lot easier to implement. All I needed to do was to separate the content into different files and link them into the main page.

### 9/13/24:
- Separated the website into multiple pages (amendments, articles, and history)
- Created a vertical timeline for the history page.
- Used online tutorials as a reference to build the timeline.

Stuck/Unstuck: I got stuck when I was trying to implement the timeline. I was able to create a simple timeline, but I couldn't get the timeline to display the content I wanted. I was able to get the timeline to display the content I wanted by following a simple tutorial of a vertical timeline. I was able to modify that boilerplate code to the needs of the project. I modified the timeline to look more modern and have more animations such as a dropdown menu and the individual sections moving to the timeline when the user hovers over it. 



### 9/16/24:
- Integrated Cooper's history content into the timeline.
- Added bulletpoints to the timeline for the diff amendments.
- Added summaries of various amendment eras.
- Styled README for better readability
