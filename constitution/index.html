          <h4>Section 2 (Composition of the House of Representatives)</h4>
          <p>
            The House of Representatives shall be composed of Members chosen
            every second Year by the People of the several States, and the
            Electors in each State shall have the Qualifications requisite for
            Electors of the most numerous Branch of the State Legislature. No
            Person shall be a Representative who shall not have attained to
            the Age of twenty five Years, and been seven Years a Citizen of
            the United States, and who shall not, when elected, be an
            Inhabitant of that State in which he shall be chosen.
            Representatives and direct Taxes shall be apportioned among the
            several States which may be included within this Union, according
            to their respective Numbers, which shall be determined by adding
            to the whole Number of free Persons, including those bound to
            Service for a Term of Years, and excluding Indians not taxed,
            three fifths of all other Persons. The actual Enumeration shall be
            made within three Years after the first Meeting of the Congress of
            the United States, and within every subsequent Term of ten Years,
            in such Manner as they shall by Law direct. The Number of
            Representatives shall not exceed one for every thirty Thousand,
            but each State shall have at Least one Representative; and until
            such enumeration shall be made, the State of New Hampshire shall
            be entitled to chuse three, Massachusetts eight, Rhode Island and
            Providence Plantations one, Connecticut five, New-York six, New
            Jersey four, Pennsylvania eight, Delaware one, Maryland six,
            Virginia ten, North Carolina five, South Carolina five, and
            Georgia three. When vacancies happen in the Representation from
            any State, the Executive Authority thereof shall issue Writs of
            Election to fill such Vacancies. The House of Representatives
            shall chuse their Speaker and other Officers; and shall have the
            sole Power of Impeachment.<a href="#ar1-2ch" id="ar1-2o" class="super">2</a>

          <h4>Section 3 (Composition of the Senate)</h4>
          <p>
            The Senate of the United States shall be composed of two Senators
            from each State, chosen by the Legislature thereof, for six Years;
            and each Senator shall have one Vote. Immediately after they shall
            be assembled in Consequence of the first Election, they shall be
            divided as equally as may be into three Classes. The Seats of the
            Senators of the first Class shall be vacated at the Expiration of
            the second Year, of the second Class at the Expiration of the
            fourth Year, and of the third Class at the Expiration of the sixth
            Year, so that one third may be chosen every second Year; and if
            Vacancies happen by Resignation, or otherwise, during the Recess
            of the Legislature of any State, the Executive thereof may make
            temporary Appointments until the next Meeting of the Legislature,
            which shall then fill such Vacancies. No Person shall be a Senator
            who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty Years, and been
            nine Years a Citizen of the United States, and who shall not, when
            elected, be an Inhabitant of that State for which he shall be
            chosen. The Vice President of the United States shall be President
            of the Senate, but shall have no Vote, unless they be equally
            divided. The Senate shall chuse their other Officers, and also a
            President pro tempore, in the Absence of the Vice President, or
            when he shall exercise the Office of President of the United
            States. The Senate shall have the sole Power to try all
            Impeachments. When sitting for that Purpose, they shall be on Oath
            or Affirmation. When the President of the United States is tried,
            the Chief Justice shall preside: And no Person shall be convicted
            without the Concurrence of two thirds of the Members present.
            Judgment in Cases of Impeachment shall not extend further than to
            removal from Office, and disqualification to hold and enjoy any
            Office of honor, Trust or Profit under the United States: but the
            Party convicted shall nevertheless be liable and subject to
            Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment, according to Law.<a href="#ar1-3ch" id="ar1-3o" class="super">3</a>

            The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and
            Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the
            Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make
            or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing
            Senators. The Congress shall assemble at least once in every Year,
            and such Meeting shall be on the first Monday in December, unless

            Qualifications of its own Members, and a Majority of each shall
            constitute a Quorum to do Business; but a smaller Number may
            adjourn from day to day, and may be authorized to compel the
            Attendance of absent Members, in such Manner, and under such
            Penalties as each House may provide. Each House may determine the
            Rules of its Proceedings, punish its Members for disorderly
            Behaviour, and, with the Concurrence of two thirds, expel a
            Member. Each House shall keep a Journal of its Proceedings, and
            from time to time publish the same, excepting such Parts as may in
            their Judgment require Secrecy; and the Yeas and Nays of the
            Members of either House on any question shall, at the Desire of
            one fifth of those Present, be entered on the Journal. Neither
            House, during the Session of Congress, shall, without the Consent
            of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other
            Place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting.

          <p>
            The Senators and Representatives shall receive a Compensation for

            during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses,

            Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other
            Place. No Senator or Representative shall, during the Time for
            which he was elected, be appointed to any civil Office under the
            Authority of the United States, which shall have been created, or
            the Emoluments whereof shall have been encreased during such time;
            and no Person holding any Office under the United States, shall be

          <h4>Section 7 (Legislative Power)</h4>
          <p>
            All Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of
            Representatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with
            Amendments as on other Bills.<a href="#ar1-4ch" id="ar1-4o" class="super">4</a>
            Every Bill which shall have passed
            the House of Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it
            become a Law, be presented to the President of the United States;
            If he approve he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it,
            with his Objections to that House in which it shall have
            originated, who shall enter the Objections at large on their
            Journal, and proceed to reconsider it. If after such
            Reconsideration two thirds of that House shall agree to pass the
            Bill, it shall be sent, together with the Objections, to the other
            House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved
            by two thirds of that House, it shall become a Law. But in all
            such Cases the Votes of both Houses shall be determined by yeas
            and Nays, and the Names of the Persons voting for and against the
            Bill shall be entered on the Journal of each House respectively.
            If any Bill shall not be returned by the President within ten Days
            (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to him, the
            Same shall be a Law, in like Manner as if he had signed it, unless
            the Congress by their Adjournment prevent its Return, in which
            Case it shall not be a Law. Every Order, Resolution, or Vote to
            which the Concurrence of the Senate and House of Representatives
            may be necessary (except on a question of Adjournment) shall be
            presented to the President of the United States; and before the
            Same shall take Effect, shall be approved by him, or being
            disapproved by him, shall be repassed by two thirds of the Senate
            and House of Representatives, according to the Rules and
            Limitations prescribed in the Case of a Bill.

              The creation of the Legislative branch allows for current 
              issues like health care reform, infrastructure funding, and national security to be debated fairly and in a balanced manner.
            </li>
            <li id= "ar1-2ch"><a href="#ar1-2o" class="super">2</a>
              A two-year cycle allows for the public to express dissatisfaction or 
              support for the direction in which they want policy to go. This shorter policy is especially relevant today as who is in the
              house is constantly changing thanks to numerous issues. 
            </li>
            <li id= "ar1-3ch"><a href="#ar1-3o" class="super">3</a>
              Importantly states that not even the president is above the law along with the fact that the impeachment itself can only 
              remove someone from office and nothing further. 
            </li>
            <li id= "ar1-4ch"><a href="#ar1-4o" class="super">4</a>
              The fact that revenue bills originate in the house is good for the people as that is the most directly elected body with
              the shortest terms. It's helpful today as one can act on their complaints towards taxation through voting on their representatives. 
            </li>
            <li id= "ar1-5ch"><a href="#ar1-5o" class="super">5</a>
              This gives congress all of their powers such as taxation, regulating commerce, handling national defense budgets. These are vital 
              to today as they are huge debate topics that all stem from congress.

              This section is primarily related to the slave trade but can be viewed through a historical lens in relation to federal regulation
              on current day immigration and refugee policies. 
            </li>
            <li id= "ar1-7ch"><a href="#ar1-7o" class="super">7</a>
              This is a vital section of the constitution as it aims to prevent states from breaking off and acting as an independent nation. 
              This prevents fragmentation of the federal system, even nowadays.

            The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the
            United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term
            of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the
            same Term, be elected, as follows:<a href="#ar2-1ch" id="ar2-1o" class="super">1</a> Each State shall appoint, in such
            Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors,
            equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which
            the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or
            Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under

            with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted

            House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes
            shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of

            whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one
            who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the
            House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of

            five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse
            the President. But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be
            taken by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote;
            A quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from

            necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the
            President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the

            or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by
            Ballot the Vice President. The Congress may determine the Time of
            chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their
            Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States. No
            Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United

            thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the

            or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers
            and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice
