                                    after declaring independence, ratified in 1781. This was viewed as weak, due to
                                    delegating most power to the states.</p>

                                <p>The Constitutional Convention was a meeting of delegates from the states, where they
                                    met in Philadelphia to draft a new Constitution. This was specifically held due to
                                    the failure of the Articles of Confederation.</p>

                                <p>The Virginia and New Jersey Plans were at the forefront of debates on Representation
                                    in Congress at the Constitutional Convention. The Virginia Plan favored the larger
                                    states, as representation was proportional to population, and the New Jersey Plan
                                    favored the smaller states, with equal representation among states.</p>

                                    Plan by establishing a bicameral legislature, or a two house congress. This
                                    bicameral legislature contains the Senate, which has equal representation among
                                    states, and the House of Representatives which has representation based on
                                    population.</p>

                                <h3>The Federalist and Anti-Federalist Papers (1787-1788)</h3>
                                <p>The Federalist Papers were a collection of 85 essays written by Alexander Hamilton,
                                    James Madison, and John Jay Under the Pseudonym, “Publius” These Papers advocated
                                    for a strong central government and the ratification of the constitution. The
                                    Anti-Federalist Papers were in response to the Federalist Papers, showing concern of
                                    the central government becoming too powerful, and was against the ratification of
                                    the constitution.</p>

                                    approval. After push from the federalists, it was ratified in 1788.</p>

                                    judiciary system which was the structure for the supreme court among other courts.
                                    This also gave the judiciary the ability to interpret laws and ensure they are

                                <p>After the Constitution was ratified, there was a concern about the protection of
                                    individual liberties. This led to the addition of the bill of rights, which were
                                    also the first ten amendments to the constitution. The Bill of Rights was able to
                                    guarantee the individual rights of the American people, such as freedom of speech,
                                    religion, and due process.</p>

                                <p>This landmark supreme court case led to the establishment of judicial review.
                                    Judicial review is given the court's power to nullify any laws that they deem
                                    unconstitutional. This contributed to the system used for checks and balances.</p>

                                    and ruled that states could not tax federal institutions. This further strengthened
