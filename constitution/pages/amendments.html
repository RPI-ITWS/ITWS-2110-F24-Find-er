                            Any citizen 18 or older is allowed to vote and can't be denied. Before this amendment,
                             the voting age limit was 21. This amendment was proposed because an 18-year-old was 
                             old enough to fight in war but unable to vote. (1971)

                            The purpose of this amendment is to forbid any change of salary or compensation until the election ends. 
                            This amendment was originally proposed by James Madison and was forgotten until reintroduced by Gregory 
                            Watson, a college student in Texas. (1992)
