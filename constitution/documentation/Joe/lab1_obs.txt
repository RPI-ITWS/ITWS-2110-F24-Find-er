Lab 1 notes: 



Plan: 

Website with the constitution: https://constitution.congress.gov/constitution/
   supposed to copy and paste the articles into our site 
Annotate the articles and amendments only 
   in these annotations "cite how it relates to your lives today" 
   paraphrase annotations from other websites 
   Our annotation Format roughly: https://law.justia.com/constitution/us/article-3/06-legislative-courts.html#fn-119
   important to note that could have used javascript for the anchor links but html had them built in 
History Page: 
   outlining the history of the constitution
   interactive timeline where you click on and it gives you more info 

HTML, CSS, and Javascript


Questions: 




to do: 
make shared azure 
Annotate sections 1-4, amendments 8-19 √
Amendments √
Look over Dereks code √
Start making annotation code√
fix js edits so that everything opens and closes properly √
Validate all pages 
   no warnings!

when coding is done, restructure files so index.html is first in line
Make sure CSS sheet is divided up and labled properly


id naming conventions: 
   origin statement: id="ar1-1o" article 1, annotation 1, origin
   annotation statment (child) : id="ar1-1ch" article 1, annotation 1, child
   <li id= "am2-1ch"><a href="#am2-1o" class="super">1</a>
   </li>

   <a href="#am27-1ch" id="am27-1o" class="super">1</a>

Things I learned: 
Anchor Tags
lots of linux commands to get my vm directories set up correctly 
lots of history regarding hte constitution and how it relates back to today 


Future improvements: 
   Could probably make it so that website is built dynamically and I didn't need to tag each annotation induvidually
